In this complex period when the husband is in the reserves and the news is mentally draining and draining,

The ability to write code when my head is 100% occupied with another topic helped me a lot.

From there I built an internal website for a second hand store

which includes information on 3 categories: products, customers and purchases

Display, add, delete and update operations of each of the categories and retrieve information by manipulations between the tables can be activated.
Through the site you can track and extract information about customer activity, purchases and updating product details.

Angular client-side

Firebase server side

Stored on the server:

I enjoyed.
