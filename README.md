In this complex period when the husband is in the reserves and the news is mentally draining and draining,

The ability to write code when my head is 100% occupied with another topic helped me a lot.

From there I built an internal website for a second hand store

.which includes information on 3 categories: products, customers and purchases

Angular client-side

Firebase server side

Stored on the server:
https://dynamic-biscochitos-fd7c25.netlify.app

I enjoyed.
